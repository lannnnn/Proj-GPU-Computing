The self developed project for course GPU-Computing
The developing will be split in several steps:

1. finish and full test of the usage of CSR format       passed
2. test the parMetis method as the current baseline - problem: Metis use the different input format(convert); the usage of Metis is much different with our design - the partition number should be fixed at very first and it is using MPI instead of GPU. Temperarily quit this part.
3. develope the sequential code as our first version     passed
4. optimizing... specific methods should be decleared later according to the performance

Usage: 
    for CPU code: in this dir run `make all`
        the target named 'blocktest' will be build in this dir
    for CUDA code: make sure have nvcc compiler. run `make cuda`
        the target named block_cuda

To run the code in cluster, referring to the script 'slurm.sh'. This script can be directly use in MARZOLA

If do not make usage of the block boundary message, the result of reordering may not give benefits for different block size.
Example: we have
 line1  1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
 line2  0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
 line3  0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1
When considering the block size = (4,4), according to Jaccard distance, line2 will be groupped with line1. But obviously, it will perform worse, but should be groupped with line3.
Plan to make usage of the block boundary message.... 
Idea: instead of using a whole line message to calculate the Jaccard distance, using a "mask" which will present the block boundary message
